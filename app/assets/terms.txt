<h3>1.	Acceptance of Terms</h3>
Technologies Peerio Inc. ("Peerio" or "we") makes certain websites, applications and service (the “Services”) available to you, subject to these terms of use (the “Terms of Use”).  By accessing, browsing and/or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to abide by and comply with these Terms of Use, which are intended to be legally binding upon you. We may change the Terms of Use at any time, at our sole discretion, by posting revisions on our website or through any applicable application, and your continued use of the Services indicates your agreement to the modified Terms of Use. Accordingly, we urge you to review the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use or any revisions thereto, please do not use the Services.
<br><br>These Terms of Use form a legally binding contract between you and Peerio. If you are an employee of a government, government department or agency (a “Government”), you are agreeing to these Terms of Use on behalf of such Government and represent and warrant to Peerio that you are authorized to enter into contracts on behalf of such Government.

Other than source code related to the Services hosted on Github (subject to the terms of the above open source licenses and Github’s terms of use), no material from the Services or any website owned, operated, licensed or controlled by Peerio may be Republished for any purpose without the express prior written consent of Peerio.

<br>Systematic retrieval of data or other content from the Services to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory without Peerio’s express written permission is prohibited.
<br>
<br>It is forbidden to Republish said Content without the express permission of Peerio, and nothing contained in the Services shall be construed as conferring by implication or otherwise any license or right under any patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary right. Except as we may expressly authorize, use of the Content is therefore strictly prohibited.

<br>
<br>

<h3>14.	Limitation of Liability</h3>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL PEERIO, OUR DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES, OUR LICENSORS, OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING OR DELIVERING THIS SITE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE OR FROM ANY ERRORS OR INFORMATION PROVIDED OR OMITTED ON THE SITE. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, EXTRA CONTRACTUAL OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OUR LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
<br>
<br>YOU AGREE THAT PEERIO HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR THE DELETION, CORRUPTION OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY MESSAGES OR OTHER CONTENT MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED BY THE SERVICE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PEERIO RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DELETE ACCOUNTS WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU THAT ARE INACTIVE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.
<br>
<br>PEERIO ASPIRES TO PRODUCE A SECURE SERVICE, WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT THIRD PARTIES CAN ASSESS ITS SECURITY. WHILE WE ARE TAKING REASONABLE MEASURES TO MAKE THE SERVICES SECURE, NO TOOL CAN MAKE ABSOLUTE SECURITY GUARANTEES AND COMPLICATED SOFTWARE CAN CONTAIN UNKNOWN VULNERABILITIES. THE SERVICES ALSO DEPEND ON THE SECURITY OF UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGIES AND ALGORITHMS, WHICH WE, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES, BELIEVE ARE ROBUST AND SECURE. BECAUSE OF THIS, PEERIO MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT ANY SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, COMPLETELY SECURE OR ERROR-FREE. ANYONE USING THE SERVICES IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE SERVICES IN LIGHT OF THEIR OWN SECURITY AND RELIABILITY NEEDS AND CONDUCT THEMSELVES ACCORDINGLY.
<br>
