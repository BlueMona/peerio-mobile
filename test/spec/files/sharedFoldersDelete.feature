Feature: Shared Folders (volumes) user 
    As a Peerio user, I have access to shared folders called volumes. I may have different 
    privileges (editor, owner) with respect to a given volume. This feature contains 
    volume operations available to all users (editors and owners).
    This feature file contains volume operations specifically related to deleting / removing files 
    from the perspective of a user who is not the owner of the volume. 

Background: 
    Given I have navigated to the files tab
    And   I have selected the FileActions (...)
    And   I have selected Delete 

#users who are not editors are not implemented in this release
#Scenario: I want to remove a file (as user) 
#    Then  the file is removed from "Your Drive"
#    But   the owner will retain access
#    And   any other users will retain access
#    And   the file binary will remain on Peerio servers (Azure)
#    And   users in rooms or chats where the file has been shared will retain access 
#    And   if I am in rooms or chats where the file has been shared
#    Then  the file will still be available to me in "All Files" 
#    And   I will retain the privileges specified in the context where the file was shared with me

Scenario: I want to leave a folder (when a non owner "deletes" a shared folder, they leave it)
    Then  the folder is removed from "Files"
    But   the owner will retain access
    And   any other users will retain access
    And   the folder binaries will remain on Peerio servers (Azure)
    And   users in rooms or chats where the file has been shared will retain access 
    And   if I am in rooms or chats where the file has been shared
    Then  the folder will still be available to me in those rooms or chats 
    #And  I will retain the privileges specified in the context where the file was shared with me
